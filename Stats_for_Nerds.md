# Performance and Statistics Overview

This document explains in detail the various performance statistics and metrics output during benchmarking of a convolutional layer. These metrics help in understanding the computational cost, resource requirements, and latency performance of the operation.

## Metrics Explained

### Kernel Size
- **Output:** `Kernel Size: {kernel_size}x{kernel_size}`
- **Explanation:**  
  The kernel size represents the dimensions of the convolutional filter used in the operation. For example, if `kernel_size` is 3, the filter is a 3Ã—3 matrix. This size affects the receptive field of the convolution and influences both the computational cost and the ability to capture spatial features.

### Input Shape
- **Output:** `Input Shape: {input_shape}`
- **Explanation:**  
  The input shape indicates the dimensions of the input tensor being fed into the convolution layer. Typically, this is expressed in the format (batch size, channels, height, width). It is a critical factor in determining how the convolution will process the data.

---

### Output Shape
- **Output:** `Output Shape: {output_shape}`
- **Explanation:**  
  The output shape describes the dimensions of the tensor produced after the convolution operation. It is determined by factors such as the input shape, kernel size, stride, and padding. The output shape is important for ensuring compatibility with subsequent layers in a neural network.

### Parameters
- **Output:** `Parameters: {params / 1e3:.2f}K`
- **Explanation:**  
  This metric shows the total number of trainable parameters in the convolution layer, divided by 1,000 to express the value in thousands (K). Fewer parameters generally indicate a lighter, more efficient model, while a higher number of parameters may imply more learning capacity but also increased risk of overfitting and higher computational cost.

---

### Total FLOPs
- **Output:** `Total FLOPs: {flops / 1e6:.2f}M`
- **Explanation:**  
  FLOPs (Floating Point Operations) quantify the total number of operations (additions, multiplications, etc.) needed to perform the convolution. This value, divided by 1e6, is expressed in millions (M) and is a measure of the computational complexity of the layer. Lower FLOPs usually indicate a more efficient operation.

---

### Multiplications
- **Output:** `Multiplications: {mults / 1e6:.2f}M`
- **Explanation:**  
  This metric shows the total number of multiplication operations performed during the convolution, divided by 1e6 to represent the count in millions. Multiplications are one of the most computationally expensive operations in neural networks.

---

### Divisions
- **Output:** `Divisions: {divs / 1e6:.2f}M`
- **Explanation:**  
  Similar to multiplications, this metric indicates the number of division operations performed, divided by 1e6 for readability. Although divisions are less frequent in standard convolutions, they may be present in normalization or other operations.

---

### Additions and Subtractions
- **Output:** `Additions and Subtractions: {add_subs / 1e6:.2f}M`
- **Explanation:**  
  This represents the total number of addition and subtraction operations performed during the convolution, expressed in millions. These operations contribute significantly to the overall computational workload.

---

### Latency Statistics
- **Latency Metrics:**
  - **Mean:** `Mean: {mean_latency:.2f}ms`  
    The average time taken per convolution operation in milliseconds.
  - **Standard Deviation:** `Std Dev: {std_latency:.2f}ms`  
    This indicates the variability in the latency measurements.
  - **Minimum:** `Min: {min_latency:.2f}ms`  
    The fastest observed execution time.
  - **Maximum:** `Max: {max_latency:.2f}ms`  
    The slowest observed execution time.
  - **P95:** `P95: {p95_latency:.2f}ms`  
    The 95th percentile latency; 95% of the operations complete faster than this value.
  - **P99:** `P99: {p99_latency:.2f}ms`  
    The 99th percentile latency; 99% of the operations complete faster than this value.

- **Explanation:**  
  Latency statistics are crucial for evaluating the real-time performance of a model. They provide insights into the consistency and reliability of the operation under different conditions. Lower latency values and smaller deviations indicate a faster and more stable performance.
